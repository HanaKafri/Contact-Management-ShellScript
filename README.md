# Contact-Management-ShellScript
I made a shell scripting system in Linux, to manage contacts file, by adding a new contact (name, phone number, address and email), listing all contacts stored, editing any  contactâ€™s name, phone number, address, and deleting any contact.
There is the text file that contains the code to run in the shell in Linux, and the contacts file that has information about contacts.
When runninng the code, just enter the name of the contacts file, and choose from teh options that will apear.
